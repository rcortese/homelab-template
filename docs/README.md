# Template documentation index

> Use this index as a starting point to customize the template. Begin with the [main README](../README.md) to understand the overall approach.

The documents below are kept generic to ease merges from the template. To record specific adaptations, use [`docs/local/`](./local/README.md) and only reference those materials when needed.

## Getting started

- [Onboarding guide](./ONBOARDING.md) — Summary of the initial flow with prerequisites, `.env` bootstrap, and required validations.
- [Template structure](./STRUCTURE.md) — Mandatory directory conventions, essential files, and validations. The directory table there is the single source of truth for the minimum structure.
- [Environment variables guide](../env/README.md) — How to map and document variables in different environments.

## Overview and integrations

- [Stack overview](./OVERVIEW.md) — Customize this overview to reflect your fork’s context and keep it updated whenever the derived repository diverges from the template.
- [Networking integration](./NETWORKING_INTEGRATION.md) — Adjust this guide to the specific connectivity dependencies and requirements, ensuring forks update this section as the topology evolves.

## Operations

- [Operations and standard scripts](./OPERATIONS.md) — Adapt the provided utilities for your project.
- [Automation entrypoints](../scripts/README.md) — Summary of available automation entrypoints in the `scripts/` directory.
- [Compose manifest combinations](./COMPOSE_GUIDE.md) — Organize overlays and profiles for different scenarios.
- [Generic backup & restore](./BACKUP_RESTORE.md) — Export/import strategies applicable to any stack.

## Application documentation

- `docs/apps/<application>.md` centralizes requirements for each application/instance (manifests, variables, routines, and alerts) generated by the bootstrap.
- [`scripts/bootstrap_instance.sh`](../scripts/bootstrap_instance.sh) with `--with-docs` creates these files from the [`doc-app.md.tpl`](../scripts/templates/bootstrap/doc-app.md.tpl) template and adds the corresponding link in the `## Applications` section of this index.
- After running the bootstrap, move the newly created item to the appropriate position in the list (for example, keeping alphabetical order) and review the text whenever a new application is added or a significant adjustment occurs.

## CI/CD automation

- [Workflow overrides](./ci-overrides.md) — Centralizes guidelines to adapt or extend pipelines without changing the template’s base workflow.

## Quality and tests

- [Test suite maintenance](../tests/README.md) — Instructions for configuring, running, and extending the template’s automated tests.
- [`run_quality_checks.sh`](../scripts/run_quality_checks.sh) — Orchestration script that runs the quality validation battery described in the testing documentation.

## Runbooks

- [Primary runbook template](./core.md) — Structure the runbook for your service’s main environment.
- [Auxiliary runbook template](./media.md) — How to document support environments or specialized workloads.

## Applications

- [Application runbooks](./apps/README.md) — Centralize the app-specific runbooks here and ensure forks keep the app index updated.

## Architectural decisions

- [Decision log](./ADR/0001-multi-environment-structure.md) — Example ADR adaptable for documenting multi-environment scenarios.

## Customization and maintenance

- [Best practices for template inheritors](./TEMPLATE_BEST_PRACTICES.md) — Guide derived teams on how to maintain documentation and sync upstream updates.
- [Local notes](./local/README.md) — Centralize runbooks, decisions, and dependencies specific to your stack.
