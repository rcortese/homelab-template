name: Project specific tests

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Reusable workflow that should be overridden in downstream projects to include
# additional checks (pytest, lint, etc). The template only provides a stub that
# warns about the absence of project-specific tests to avoid CI failures and
# minimize conflicts during updates.
